                        StraySpace is (meant to be) an installation about saving 'stray' aliens. They're lost and need energy to find their way home. To give them your energy, you have to deal with perform a ritual in front of creepy, screaming windmills.

                            <p> Can we succeed at giving people a context to do large, wild movements, together? To me, the project is a sort of way to challenge
                                the recent situation where people are inside, confined and alone. Now that they're already outside, why not make them 
                                make full use of the space and everyone's presence?

                                in a dark room to increase the intensity of creepyness. The aliens produce sound cues indicating their presence

                    <h2>Form</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify"> The installation consisted of three windmill boxes, suspended on pillars, with drills working as motors to 
                        spin foam blades. The pillars were those of the bridge leading to the UQ Lakes Bus Stop. The drills were
                        controlled by motor drivers (except for one windmill that had a relay instead) that received 
                        instructions from Arduino Leonardos.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-justify"> Whenever someone moved (danced) nearby the windmills, a passive infrared sensor would detect their motion, 
                        while an ultrasonic sensor would check how far they were. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">The arduinos also connected to a mac mini, which hosted a game made in unity. The game was projected onto dark fabric</p>
                    <h2>Function</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify">Depending on the distance and how much the users moved, the windmills would spin in patterns and have the LED's glow in either a red, or rainbow 
                        colour. If the "correct" dance was performed and the windmill became rainbow coloured, depending on the windmill one of the aliens would stop falling, 
                        or the portal door would open. When two aliens met at the open portal, there was a chime that indicates they were saved and had reached home.
                    </p>

                    <p>If the user was too close, or if they stopped moving, the aliens fall downwards. Until they were saved the aliens keep falling, producing a scream.
                        Sad music played in the background on a loop.
                    </p>

                <h5  >Getting the Idea Out There</h5>
                <p class="text-justify"> Before most actual development started, I wanted to work on making sure I had a <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">clear 
                    understanding of the concept </span> first. This may seem counterintuitive since the idea I worked on was partially my own, but 
                    an important question I think everyone should be able to answer at any time is "what or who is this for". 
                </p>
                <div class="col-sm-6 clusterBox">
                <h4>Mini Compositions</h4>
                <p>To make sure I could always answer that, I started with <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">compositions that mixed sketches, memes, and pictures</span>
                    . These were only for myself, and generally lived on my journal, someone else looking at these would likely 
                    interpret them differently than I would. But they were useful for giving myself a <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">strong impression</span> of the feelings or reactions I was aiming for, so that I could explain 
                    what I wanted to do to other people without too much pausing in our conversations.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Doodles</h4>
                <p><span class="quickBrightEmphasis">Doodles</span> helped quite a bit too, quick "napkin sketches" (although I did mine digitally) used to
                    prepare for bodystorming, or record useful movements, stances and poses. The examples I'm using here are from my project inspiration however, because 
                    they show better contrast than the doodles I made for the actual installation. I also made a number of 
                    <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">storyboards</span>, but those will be further explained later.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Mini Windmill</h4>
                <p> Ignoring the site visit and research that everyone needed to do - I made a mini windmill using random bits and 
                    pieces stolen from the workshop. This wasn't really useful as an actual part of the installation, but as a quick, 
                    ten minute effort to see what I would need, it helped in <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">identifying the key 
                    components</span> - a wide base / foundation, a tower/ pillar, a motor to spin the windmill, a centerpiece to hold
                    blades, and  the blades themselves.
                </p>
                <h4>Reflecting For Next Time</h4>
                <p> Drafting and planning for the windmill (the major physical bit) should have been a team effort. Because I handled early planning and drafting alone, 
                    I think it <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">established a precedent</span> that I had the physical aspect 
                    under control, which was rarely true, and might have hampered how complete our prototype was later in the 
                    process. In week 8, our prototypes ended up consisting of several sub-prototypes, rather than everyone's collective work
                    all connected as one prototype.

                    <p class="text-justify">For context, with a lot of guidance from Clay, I had a drill that could connect to an arduino, and inside it where the trigger used to be, 
                        we had a relay. Later on, the relay was replaced with a motor driver, and even later on, I had a motor driver for every drill. </p>
                    
                    <p class="text-justify">At least, that  was the plan. Much later in the semester I <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">took for granted the location of a pin</span>, assuming that "the rightmost pin is 
                        always the one that connects to power". However, for one of the drills, the pins were inverted, so the leftmost one was power -
                    my mistake here being not looking at the label on the motor drivers actual board before wiring in the cable. This <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">caused a small fire 
                    and burned both the motor driver, and the brand new Arduino Leonardo</span> connected to it. To avoid a repeat of this, from that point forward I always had
                     comparison pictures of what wire goes where stored on my phone, as well as triple checking the board before bringing the arduino over.

                        To see the limits of the motor driver, I started playing around with programming them through arduino, with the videos to the right being examples of what I managed to do.
                        By <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">commanding the drill to spin at specific power values, I could get it to produce specific 'notes'</span>... using the drills motor spinning 
                        almost like an instrument. So, if I asked it to spin fast (150 power) and then immediately spin slow in the other direction,
                        (10 power) It would be like doing a high pitched note, and a low pitched note. I could also control the duration the "note" was held
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The next step was making the drills run specific combinations of powers (so, specific speeds) depending on the distance, as seen in the second video. Admittedly, at first
                        I only tested out a bunch of ranges I expected people to interact at, and gave each of the seven a colour and corresponding speed. Had I developed this further, perhaps
                        I could almost have given... <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">a different personality for each windmill</span> perhaps. Like one that always starts out with aggressive, short notes, another that does long, sustained notes, and so on. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">This is probably one part I'd most be willing to return to. I really like manufactured experiences that make me feel like I'm standing at 
                        the precipice of madness, and one way to achieve that would be to make robots talking at a person in some sort of invisible, Machine language.
                        This was unfortunately another case of me <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">deprioritising something interesting, to work on what was necessary</span> instead, as at that point the physical
                        construction was more important. But I do feel like refocusing at this point meant losing some of that... spicyness
                        , the edge in the teeth, that made the initial idea something I really wanted to pursue.

                    <h5>Making Sure All the Scattered Pieces Fit in One Box</h5>
                    <p class="text-justify">I spent the most amount of time through the course on this, the remainder of the physical form of the installation at various stages, through a number of different iterations of the concept. 
                        A great opportunity to try out a number of pieces of technology, and improve my handiwork.
                    </p>
                    <div class="col-sm-12">

                        <h4>Drafting and Preparation</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify"> Everything up to this point had been familiar territory, but the Windmill Tower, or Base, the part that 
                            supports the main moving bit, was new, especially at the two meter scale I initially wanted.
                             </p>
                        
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            The scale was a guarantee that the pieces would need to be machined. I started with making models in tinkerCAD, since 
                            UQInnovate 3d prints pieces. This would allow me to start with an early partial scale model. In hindsight, if I went back now
                            I would tell myself to immediately go for full scale and save a weeks worth of time fiddling with tinkerCAD, which had a lot of 
                            limitations with how shapes were constructed, aside from a variety of quality of life issues.
                         </p>

                        <p class="text-justify">
                           I then switched to Autodesk Fusion360 instead - which had it's own learning code, but when integrated with slicer3D, it was an ideal
                           tool for discovery, much like trying to <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">find the right jigsaw puzzle piece shapes to fit</span>. In this case, I'd just need to make a general shape 
                           in Fusion, import that to slicer, decide how that is going to placed onto a piece of material for cutting, and then export it as a dxf file to
                           lazer cut or possibly throw onto the Computer and Numerical Control / CNC Machine.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            At that point I got feedback indicating that we should scale down our project and place it elsewhere, so instead I started working 
                            on the new form, which was meant to be a housing, or box, rather than a tower. Suspended rectangles are considerably easier to design 
                            compared to conical housings, so I used draft illustrations instead.

                            With Clay's help and a panel saw, we could ensure a straight cut on all our boards, without any odd angles or the need to slowly feed the material into the blade
                            like with a bandsaw. I focused on assembly next, but there's not much exciting about that - each section needed at least two 3 cm screws any time it was connected to another section.  
                         </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            We also needed a way to secure the boxes, so I cut and bent some threaded rods into U-shapes
                             slightly larger than the pillars we'd be attaching the box to, then filed down the edges, to avoid cross threading.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            The next step was what went inside the boxes - a shelf placed about a third of the height inside, supported by two wood off cuts secured to both the side and back.
                            These shelves supported the drills, and had holes in them that allowed us to ziptie them down. <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">To make sure that these shelves were at level height, I used a bubble level</span>
                            to double check every piece inside the box. In hindsight, I should have done this for every piece of the boxes in general - because I didn't, I missed the fact that one of the boxes
                            had a top piece 5 mm larger than the rest of the top pieces, which resulted in a crooked box. 
                         </p>

                         <p class="text-justify"> Four other off cuts were used for each box, two close to the top, and two close to the bottom. These had predrilled holes for screws, so every time we wanted to install 
                            our acrylic panels to contain everything inside, we'd nust need to replace those.

                        before someone even approaches the site. This section talks about some of the things I consider small but meaningful, that had the potential to influence
                        whether someone would participate. </p>

                        <p class="text-justify"> As an additional task during one of the weekends of downtime, I started with music development. Part of the identity of the installation early on 
                            was meant to be the impression the windmills were "screaming" at you, so the first round of music (check out the soundcloud section below) was focused
                            on <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">finding that "scream" </span>. Not something immediately unnerving like a real person's scream, but mechanical,
                            alien or robotic sounds instead.  Since our aliens were coming in from a different dimension, it made sense the music and any sound cues was supposed to give that impression as well.</p>
                        
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Around that time I formally developed the <span class="quickBrightEmphasis">storyboard</span> as well - which had a few purposes. It served as a sort of checkpoint to see where
                            every teammate had gone during their exploration, and helped us figure out what was left to do. But most importantly, it gave an idea of what a start to finish 
                            interaction might look like, with more specifics. One major weakness though, was neglecting to consider that storyboards work best when theres several scenarios, 
                            whereas the one I made only had two images diverging from the path. This is a mistake I'd made before, but in trying to rush in with the main scenario, I neglected Including
                            more detail in the individual frames.

                    parents would supervise their children, but eventually get so enthralled that they too would participate 
                    in the installation, mirroring or just guiding their children, sometimes by holding their hands.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Couples also frequently tried out the installation together, often right as another group was taking off, 
                    we’d have couples coming in to take over two windmills and continue saving the aliens. This tended the case 
                    for ones who initially started out observing however - it wasn’t as common to see people who just stumbled 
                    by immediately participate.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Groups of friends were the final major participants, there was a sort of… jovial and unconstrained attitude 
                    amongst people there with their friends. The dynamics weren’t always the same, some people were too shy to 
                    potentially embarrass themselves while their peers were around, while others treated being the fool as 
                    something that brightens the mood. This isn’t to say this was planned or intended necessarily, but it could 
                    be an avenue for future development, possibly with more points of input than just the three we already have.
                    </p>
                <p class="text-justify">It was relatively rare to see lone individuals come up to participate in the installation, although because 
                    the installation was at the end of the day, it’s likely that most people passing by alone had a purpose in 
                    mind when walking by, whereas groups of people didn’t necessarily need an aim or goal to hang out, making 
                    them more likely to want to try something unusual like our installation.
                    </p>
                <p class="text-justify">I had simply expected the publics reaction to mirror my own when interacting with similar 
                    installations... that of confusion, puzzlement, and visceral recoil, so to see such frequent and consistent 
                    engagement with the installation does mean that perhaps I should reevaluate how much of the reaction I expected
                    was just a reflection of how I would react, rather than reality.

                <h2>Dark Dreams Disappear</h2>
                <h5>Aspirations for Dark Desire Fade Away, to Reveal Only Bland Porridge</h5>
                    <p class="text-justify">Compared to the ideal, the actual installation had a few clear differences - for one the scale of the installation was smaller and more compressed, although that in itself didn’t stop it from drawing attention - the sounds the installation produced, especially the sound of the aliens screaming, drew plenty of attention… which was self sustaining, because after the first round of participants were drawn in, successive rounds of observers would also gain an interest in the installation…. With minimal lulls through the night.
                     </p>
                     <p class="text-justify">I’ve also become aware that over the semester, I’ve gradually been toning down and simplifying the idea to make it easier to communicate with my teammates - especially because some teammates have… different grasps of English than others, which made conveying even basic changes to the concept become half hour slogs. It simply got too tedious trying to keep everyone on track and re-explaining things. The issue from there is that my original goals of engaging with negative emotions and designing to challenge peoples perceptions had to be cut back on so extremely, that that aspect is almost non-existent. 
                     </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">I think in many small ways, I’ve inadvertently killed the parts of the installation I was most interested in working on - particularly since I spent so much time on the physical build, that I’ve ended up neglecting the emotional goals of the installation in various ways.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">For example, the aliens were initially supposed to cry out for help, but because someone hadn’t completed their share of the work, myself and other teammates had to handle both our existing tasks, and take over the unfinished work, leaving no time to work on quality of life features like the sounds the aliens were meant to make. As a result, when the aliens fade away, the impact of their disappearance is less intense. This might have been partially mitigated through the use of stock assets, but stock assets don’t achieve nearly the intended experience as much as something purpose built could.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Another change was that the windmills, that were meant to produce sound cues, are instead silent except for the sound of their motor - which limits how expressive they could be. They’re no longer screaming windmills, just mildly humming windmills instead.

                <h2>Truth to Theme</h2>
                <h5>Does This Really Meet the Brief Anymore?</h5>
                    <p class="text-justify">While at first I would have said we achieved an acceptable result, the extreme frequency of people grabbing 
                    onto the foam blades of the windmill meant that if COVID restrictions were tighter, we would essentially 
                    have failed. Despite warnings everywhere, including on top of the installation boxes themselves, that you’re 
                    ant to perform actions, plenty of children and even adults were so curious about getting the moving bit to spin
                     that they’d simply latch on to the blades and try to force the interaction. </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">On one hand, it’s great they were enthusiastic, but on the other, the fact that we had to babysit the installation the entire time, and that people didn’t manage to always figure out the context based on their own investigation or adherence to the rules, means it’s probably back to the drawing board in terms of how we’re going to keep the installation a no-touch focused interaction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">On the front of human connection… I have mixed feelings - to me the goal was that the installation could be a place to spark connections and build a sense of collaborative play… but I didn’t plan for what happens after that, or the kind of followup people were ideally supposed to  have. Perhaps if we were being loose with the term it could be said that by sharing the space and doing the same weird things, people were connecting, but if sharing a space and doing the same things are all it takes to form a connection, wouldn’t that be like saying “we’re all stuck in traffic together right now, so we’re all connected”?

                <h2>Abandoned Strays</h2>
                <h5>Aliens Who?</h5>

                <p class="text-justify">Two of the major success criteria we chose earlier on were “at least twenty pairs of saved aliens” and “the 
                    installation is active at least 75% of the day”, both of which were achieved… but I would say that although 
                    there were brief instances of people from separate family groups interacting, most of the time the effort
                     was a passive one. It was quite rare to see complete strangers communicate with each other as well, and 
                     group dynamics in general didn’t really form as intended.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">This could possibly be attributed to the drop in, drop out nature of the installation, anyone can join in 
                    and help out, if they wanted to. However, most of the time it seems that participants treated “achieving 
                    the rainbow colours” an indication that they had succeeded, rather than that they were saving aliens. The 
                    instant gratification is just as good as the long term reward... or probably a better take would just be that 
                    our aliens haven't really succeeded at drawing in peoples empathy.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I would go so far as to say that the vast majority of participants didn’t really care about the aliens, 
                    as even if they noticed them, they would rarely make saving any a priority. I think it’s because the 
                    disincentive for allowing the aliens to fall wasn’t strong enough, but it’s likely also an issue of a lack 
                    of solid limits, because it’s an endless loop, there’s not enough reason to get invested in the current set
                    of aliens over any others.
